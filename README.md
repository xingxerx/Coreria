#### Building (C++)

```bash
# Compile the original parallel demo
g++ main.cpp -o game_engine_parallel_demo -std=c++11 -pthread

# Compile the enhanced graphics version
g++ main_simple_graphics.cpp Vector2D.cpp graphics.cpp -o game_engine_simple_graphics -std=c++11 -pthread

# Or use the Makefile
make all
```

#### Running (C++)

```bash
# Run the original parallel engine
./game_engine_parallel_demo

# Run the enhanced graphics version
./game_engine_simple_graphics

# Run the walkable game (turn-based)
./game_walkable_simple

# Run the interactive SFML version (real-time)
./compile_interactive.sh  # Compile first
./game_interactive_simple

# Or use make targets
make run-original
make run-simple
```

### üìÅ Project Structure (C++ Example)

(Refer to the C++ source files for detailed structure. Key components include `main.cpp`, `main_simple_graphics.cpp`, `Vector2D.h/cpp`, `graphics.h/cpp`, `GameEnvironment.h/cpp`, `GameObject.h/cpp`, and the `assets/` directory for SVG textures.)

### üîß Technical Highlights (C++)

#### Parallel Processing
- **Multi-threaded updates**: Distributes collectible processing across CPU cores
- **Thread safety**: Mutex-protected shared state
- **Load balancing**: Dynamic thread allocation based on object count

#### SVG Graphics System
- **Procedural generation**: Runtime SVG creation for game assets
- **Texture management**: Efficient loading and caching
- **Multiple renderers**: Console and HTML output support

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient collision detection**: AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)
- **Memory management**: Smart pointers and RAII principles
- **Minimal dependencies**: Pure C++11 with standard library

### üé® SVG Asset Examples (C++)

Player Character:
```svg
<svg width="50" height="50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect x="10" y="15" width="30" height="25" fill="#4169E1" rx="5"/>
  <circle cx="25" cy="10" r="7.5" fill="#FFE4B5"/>
  <!-- Eyes, arms, legs... -->
</svg>
```

Collectible Coin:
```svg
<svg width="20" height="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <circle cx="10" cy="10" r="8" fill="#FFD700" stroke="#FFA500" stroke-width="2"/>
  <text x="10" y="12" text-anchor="middle" font-size="8" fill="#B8860B">$</text>
</svg>
```

### üìä Performance Metrics (C++)

- **Threading**: Utilizes all available CPU cores (typically 20+ threads)
- **Frame rate**: 60 FPS target with 16.67ms frame time
- **Memory**: Efficient asset management with shared pointers
- **Scalability**: Handles 1000+ game objects with parallel processing

### üêõ Debugging (C++)

The C++ engine includes comprehensive error handling and debugging features:
- Thread-safe logging
- Memory leak prevention
- Graceful error recovery
- Performance monitoring

## Epoch of Elria (Rust Version)

The Rust version of Epoch of Elria is a port and re-imagination of the engine, focusing on 3D graphics rendering using the `kiss3d` library. It aims to explore modern game development practices in Rust.

### ‚ú® Features (Rust)

- **3D Graphics**: Utilizes the `kiss3d` library for 3D rendering.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: (Inferred from typical Rust game engine design, details in `src/lib.rs` and components).
- **Modern Tooling**: Built with Cargo, the Rust build system and package manager.
- **Safety Focus**: Leverages Rust's memory safety features.
- **Cross-Platform**: Builds on Rust's cross-platform capabilities.

### üöÄ Quick Start (Rust)

#### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain (install via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))

#### Building (Rust)

```bash
# Build the engine and examples in debug mode
cargo build

# Build for release (optimized)
cargo build --release
```

#### Running (Rust)

The `src/main.rs` file currently serves as a test suite for engine components.
```bash
# Run the test suite
cargo run
```

To run the full graphics demo (as suggested in `src/main.rs` comments):
```bash
# Run the main graphics demo (if available as a separate example or main function)
cargo run --release
# (Note: The specific target for the graphics demo might be an example, e.g., cargo run --release --example your_demo_name)
# Based on `examples/complete_rpg_demo.rs`, you might run:
cargo run --release --example complete_rpg_demo
```
Check `Cargo.toml` and the `examples` directory for specific runnable targets.

## üéÆ Example Games

### The Dream Weaver's Heart
**The Dream Weaver's Heart** is an immersive RPG built with the C++ version of the Epoch of Elria engine. It is set in the infinite Metaverse, where consciousness shapes reality through stories, memories, and pure melody. Four unique heroes must transform The One - an ancient entity of absolute order - through collaboration rather than destruction.

For more details on this game, its features, and how to build and run it, please see its dedicated guide:

- **Audio system**: Sound effects and music support
- **Input handling**: Advanced keyboard, mouse, and controller support
- **Networking**: Multiplayer capabilities
- **Advanced physics**: More complex interactions, gravity, friction, and forces
- **Level editor**: Visual game world creation tools
- **Expanded Rust Features**: Further development of the Rust engine's 3D capabilities and game systems.
