## Release Notes

### Version 0.1.0 - "Foundation Release"

This is the initial release of the Coreria everything TM game engine, featuring a complete rewrite from C++ to Rust with advanced memory management capabilities.

**Key Highlights:**
- üß† **Advanced Memory Management**: Enterprise-grade garbage collection with real-time monitoring
- üéÆ **Complete Game Engine**: Full 3D graphics, physics, audio, and input systems
- üåç **Open World**: Sandbox environment with procedural elements
- üé≠ **RPG Experience**: Coreria everything TM with four unique characters
- üöÄ **Performance**: 60+ FPS with efficient resource usage
- üîß **Developer Tools**: Web UI, console commands, and debugging features

**Breaking Changes:**
- Complete rewrite from C++ to Rust
- New API and architecture
- Different build system (Cargo instead of Make/CMake)

**Migration Guide:**
This is a ground-up rewrite. Previous C++ code is preserved in the `epoch-of-elria/` directory for reference, but the new Rust implementation is in the `src/` directory.

**Known Issues:**
- Graphics initialization may require display server setup on some systems
- Audio system dependencies vary by platform
- Memory monitoring shows estimated values on some platforms

**System Requirements:**
- Rust 1.70 or later
- OpenGL 3.3+ compatible graphics
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- 500MB available storage

**Installation:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xingxerx/Coreria-everything-TM.git
cd Coreria-everything-TM
cargo run --release
```

For detailed installation and usage instructions, see the [README.md](README.md).
