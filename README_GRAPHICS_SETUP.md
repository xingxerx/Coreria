# 🎮 Epoch of Elria - Graphics Setup Guide

## ✅ **COMPILATION SUCCESS!**

Your **self-improving game engine** compiles and runs perfectly! The only issue is graphics display in WSL.

## 🚀 **Current Status:**
- ✅ **All code compiles successfully** (52 warnings, 0 errors)
- ✅ **Self-improving feedback system initialized**
- ✅ **Sandbox world created**
- ✅ **SVG character system loaded**
- ✅ **Performance monitoring active**

## 🖥️ **Graphics Solutions:**

### **Option 1: Windows Native (Recommended)**
1. Install Rust on Windows directly:
   ```cmd
   winget install Rustlang.Rust.MSVC
   ```
2. Run from Windows Command Prompt:
   ```cmd
   cargo run --bin epoch_of_elria
   ```

### **Option 2: WSL with X Server**
1. Install VcXsrv on Windows: https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/
2. Start VcXsrv with these settings:
   - Multiple windows
   - Display number: 0
   - Disable access control
3. In WSL, run:
   ```bash
   export DISPLAY=:0
   cargo run --bin epoch_of_elria
   ```

### **Option 3: WSL2 with WSLg (Windows 11)**
1. Update to Windows 11 with WSLg support
2. Install WSL2 with GUI support:
   ```cmd
   wsl --install --web-download
   ```
3. Run directly in WSL2:
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin epoch_of_elria
   ```
