## üåü The Dream Weaver's Heart - A Narrative 3D RPG

**The Dream Weaver's Heart** is an immersive RPG set in the infinite Metaverse, where consciousness shapes reality through stories, memories, and pure melody. Four unique heroes must unite to transform The One - an ancient entity of absolute order - through collaboration rather than destruction.

### üé≠ Main Characters

-   **Xing (The Weaver)** - Master of narrative reality, dwells in the Infinite Library
-   **Xerx (The Liberator)** - Memory warrior fighting mental oppression in sterile reality
-   **The Heart** - Emotional catalyst born from a dying book, eager to participate in stories
-   **Lyra (Pure Melody)** - Awakener of consciousness through harmonic resonance

### üëπ The Antagonist

-   **The One** - Ancient entity seeking absolute order through narrative suppression

### üéÆ Core Gameplay Features

-   **Character Switching System**: Switch between any of the four heroes, each with unique abilities.
-   **3D Metaverse Exploration**: Navigate infinite narrative dimensions with WASD controls in a real-time 3D world.
-   **RPG Progression**: Level up characters, learn new abilities, and build relationships for synergy bonuses.
-   **Collaborative Storytelling**: Create stories that become part of the game world and transform the antagonist through love and harmony, not violence.
-   **Advanced Systems**:
    -   **Memory System**: Reconstruct complete memories from scattered fragments.
    -   **Harmony System**: Build resonance between characters to achieve ultimate power.
    -   **Narrative Magic**: Use story-based spells to alter reality.

## ü§ñ Arch Reactor AI - Moderation Tool

A chat moderation tool written in Rust. This tool is a separate, experimental project.

### Features

-   Filters messages based on a list of banned words.
-   Detects excessive use of capitalization.
-   Configurable via `moderation_config.toml`.
-   Includes a placeholder for integration with a "Gemini" AI for advanced analysis.

### Running

```bash
# Navigate to the epoch-of-elria directory and run
cargo run --bin ArchReactorAIlogic
```

## üß† Meta-Cognition Layer

A small, self-contained Rust program demonstrating a concept of self-reflection for AI systems. It is likely intended as a conceptual layer for the Arch Reactor AI.

### Running

```bash
# Navigate to the epoch-of-elria directory and run
cargo run --bin Meta-CognitionLayer
```

## Legacy Engine

The repository also contains the original 2D C++ game engine with parallel processing and SVG graphics. This was the precursor to "The Dream Weaver's Heart."

For more information on the legacy engine, please see the [LEGACY_README.md](LEGACY_README.md).
