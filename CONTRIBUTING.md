## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use `cargo fmt` for formatting
- Follow Rust naming conventions
- Add documentation comments for public APIs
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Testing
- Write unit tests for new functions
- Add integration tests for major features
- Test memory management functionality
- Verify performance doesn't regress

### Memory Management
- Use the engine's garbage collector for managed objects
- Implement proper cleanup in Drop traits
- Test for memory leaks with the built-in leak detector
- Follow RAII principles

### Performance
- Profile code changes with benchmarks
- Maintain 60+ FPS target
- Use object pools for frequently allocated objects
- Minimize allocations in hot paths

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Systems
- **Engine Core** (`src/lib.rs`): Main engine coordination
- **Memory Management** (`src/memory_*.rs`): GC and resource management
- **Rendering** (`src/rendering.rs`): 3D graphics and UI
- **Physics** (`src/physics.rs`): Collision and dynamics
- **Audio** (`src/audio.rs`): Sound and music
- **Game Objects** (`src/game_objects.rs`): Entity management

### Design Principles
- **Memory Safety**: Leverage Rust's ownership system
- **Performance**: 60+ FPS with efficient resource usage
- **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Extensibility**: Plugin-friendly architecture

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
cargo test

# Specific test
cargo test test_memory_management

# With output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Memory tests
cargo test memory --features memory-testing
```

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual function testing
- **Integration Tests**: System interaction testing
- **Memory Tests**: GC and leak detection testing
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark validation

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Use `///` for public API documentation
- Include examples in doc comments
- Document safety requirements for unsafe code
- Explain complex algorithms and data structures

### User Documentation
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add examples to documentation
- Update build instructions if needed
- Create tutorials for new features

## üêõ Debugging

### Common Issues
- **Graphics Initialization**: Ensure proper display server setup
- **Memory Leaks**: Use built-in leak detector
- **Performance**: Profile with `cargo bench`
- **Audio**: Check system audio dependencies

### Debug Tools
```bash
# Debug build with logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run

# Memory debugging
cargo run --features memory-debug

# Performance profiling
cargo bench
```
